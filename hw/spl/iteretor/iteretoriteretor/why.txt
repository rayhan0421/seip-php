It is important to understand that most classes that do not implement 
Iterators have reasons as most likely they do not allow the full Iterator feature (see below) set.
 If so, techniques should be provided to prevent misuse, 
\otherwise expect exceptions or fatal errors.

public __construct ( Traversable $iterator )
public mixed current ( void )
public Traversable getInnerIterator ( void )
public scalar key ( void )
public void next ( void )
public void rewind ( void )
public bool valid ( void )

notes: This class permits access to methods of the inner iterator via the __call magic method.
