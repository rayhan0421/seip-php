 when what you need to iterate over…is another Iterator that is itself iterating over something. For this very instance,
 the SPL has defined an interface for us the OuterIterator.

The OuterIterator interface extends the Iterator interface but adds a single method, getInnerIterator().

...............
OuterIterators are used anytime you need to manipulate an Iterator
