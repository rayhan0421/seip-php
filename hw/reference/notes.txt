References in PHP are a means to access the same variable content by different names. 
*** They are not like C pointers.
**** you cannot perform pointer arithmetic using them ,
***** they are not actual memory addresses.

A reference in PHP is simply a variable corresponding to the same value as another variable. References can be explicitly created using a special form of the assignment operator with an ampersand after the equals sign. For example:


// create two variables referencing the same value
$example1 =  'something';
$example2 =& $example1;
n this case, $example1 and $example2 refer to the same value
