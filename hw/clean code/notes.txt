You should try to avoid using else statements when writing code. At first I was confused when I heard this, but after some time I started to realize he was right. In 80% of cases where I used else before I just realized I no longer needed it if i turned the condition of my if-statement around. Looking at the above example it would look something like this.

<?php
function writeFile($fullpath, $content)
{
    if (!is_writable($fullpath)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (!$fp = fopen($fullpath,'w')) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!fwrite($fp,$content)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}
