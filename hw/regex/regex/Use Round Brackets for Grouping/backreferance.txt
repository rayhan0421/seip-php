Round Brackets Create a Backreference 
..........
Besides grouping part of a regular expression together, round brackets also create a “backreference”. 
A backreference stores the part of the string matched by the part of the regular expression inside the parentheses
...................
The regex «Set(Value)?» matches "Set" or "SetValue". In the first case, the first backreference will be empty, 
because it did not match anything. In the second case, the first backreference will contain "Value". 

How to Use Backreferences:
-------------------------------

Backreferences allow you to reuse part of the regex match. You can reuse it inside the regular expression (see below), or afterwards. 
What you can do with it afterwards, depends on the tool you are using. In EditPad Pro or PowerGREP, you can use the backreference 

in the replacement text during a search-and-replace operation by typing \1 (backslash one) into the replacement text. 
If you searched for «EditPad (Lite|Pro)» and use “\1 version” as the replacement,

 the actual replacement will be “Lite version” in case „EditPad Lite” was matched,
 and “Pro version” in case „EditPad Pro” was matched.
