By default, the event scheduler thread is not enabled. To enable and start the event scheduler thread, you need to execute the following command:

SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
To disable and stop the event the event scheduler thread, you execute the SET GLOBAL command with value of the event_scheduler is OFF:
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = OFF;

1.First, you specify the event name after the  CREATE EVENT clause. The event name must be unique within a database schema.
CREATE EVENT [IF NOT EXIST]  event_name
ON SCHEDULE schedule
DO
event_body

2.Second, you put a schedule after the  ON SCHEDULE clause. If the event is a one-time event, you use the syntax: AT timestamp [+ INTERVAL]. If the event is a recurring event, you use the EVERY clause: EVERY interval STARTS timestamp [+INTERVAL] ENDS timestamp [+INTERVAL].

CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS test_event_01
ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
DO
----------------------------------------------------
3.Third, you place the SQL statements after the DO keyword. It is important to notice that you can call a stored procedure inside the body of the event. In case you have compound SQL statements, you can wrap them in a  BEGIN END block.
CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS test_event_01
ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
DO
  INSERT INTO messages(message,created_at)
  VALUES('Test MySQL Event 1',NOW());
