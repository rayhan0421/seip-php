1. Saving A Model And Relationships

Sometimes you may wish to save not only a model, but also all of its relationships. To do so, you may use the push method:

$user->push();

2.Defining A Query Scope // just method for clean query 

Scopes allow you to easily re-use query logic in your models. To define a scope, simply prefix a model method with scope:

class User extends Model {

    public function scopePopular($query)
    {
        return $query->where('votes', '>', 100);
    }

    public function scopeWomen($query)
    {
        return $query->whereGender('W');
    }

}

example Utilizing A Query Scope

$users = User::popular()->women()->orderBy('created_at')->get();
// here popular is method scopePopular and women is method of scopewomen
