php artisan make:model User
------------------------
1. 
class Game extends Eloquent
{
    public $timestamps = false;
    public $table = 'gamezilla_roar';
    protected $primaryKey = 'custom_pk'; // default is id
    
}
======================
Note: Eloquent will also assume that each table has a primary key column named id. You may define a primaryKey property to override this convention. Likewise, you may define a connection property to override the name of the database connection that should be used when utilizing the model.
=====================
2.To create an Eloquent model for a legacy table that has no primary key,
 simply add the following to your model:

class Game extends Eloquent
{
    public $timestamps = false;
    public $table = 'gamezilla_roar';
    protected $primaryKey = null; // if table has no primary key
    public $incrementing = false; // if primary key is not auto increment
    
}

==============
f you do not wish to have these columns automatically maintained, set the $timestamps property on your model to false.
================

=============
When using guarded, you should still never pass Input::get() or any raw array of user controlled input into a save or update method, as any column that is not guarded may be updated.
