$game = Juego:: find( 1 );
 $game-> delete();

We can also delete a single instance or multiple instances of our models, using
their ids, and the static method destroy ().

Juego:: destroy( 1 );
or
Juego:: destroy( 1 , 2, 3);

or

uego:: destroy( array( 1 , 2, 3));

2. Album:: where( 'artista' , '=' , 'Matt Nathanson' )
-> delete();
 /// Retrieve all the albums that have a column with artist Matt Nathanson value.
Then we use the delete () method to delete rows from the database.

3. for empty table 

Album:: truncate();
