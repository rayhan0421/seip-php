<p>Great article, I do have some questions though. I've been thinking 
about this subject the last few weeks and am wondering if it would truly
 be as simple as switching out an EloquentRepository with a 
RedisRepository...</p><p>The problem I see is that the controller is 
expecting to get a User object, and the User class extends Eloquent. If 
you swap out the repository for a RedisRepository, the controller is 
still expecting a User object that extends Eloquent, so removing the 
coupling is not as simple as just swapping out the repository. I feel 
like you would have to have another User class that was standalone, and 
in the EloquentRepository you would have to create EloquentUsers and use
 the attributes on those models to fill the attributes on the regular 
User class that isn't coupled to the ORM.</p><p>Also, assuming you would
 move the "save" method to the repository and off of the object (since 
we're sort of doing a Data Mapper thing here instead of Active Record), 
how would you handle inserting related models using the repository?</p><p>Genuinely
 curious on your thoughts, this has been bugging me for a while! Enjoyed
 your other Laravel articles as well, looking forward to reading more.</p>

<p>No, it's not as easy as swapping out your interface. There are a LOT of design decisions that need to be made when</p><p>1) Choosing a data store</p><p>2) Migrating from one data store to another.</p><p>MySQL
 and Redis and MongoDB and Riak and Whatever™ are not interchangeable 
tools. The only reasonable hot-swappable data stores would probably be 
postgres and maybe something like SQLServer or something.</p><p>Redis 
isn't the same sort of store (ephemeral, key/value) as Mongo 
(schemaless, map-reduce)  as MySQL (relational). There are certainly 
times when you realize that you've chosen the wrong tool for the job, 
and need to migrate to something else (we're in the process of this 
right now).</p><p>The reality is, it's taken us weeks of man power to 
move something in MongoDB to something else, and the reason isn't that 
we don't have the man power or we didn't follow this repository pattern.</p><p>The
 reason is that these tools are work fundamentally differently. The 
amount of code that has to be change to work with a different data model
 is just astounding.</p><p>The way these migrations typically work in a production environment is as follows:</p><p>1) Realize that you're using the wrong tool<br>2) Design a better system<br>3) Implement the better system<br>4) Allow the better system to run along side of the incorrect/bad/slow system<br>5) Make sure you're getting what you need out of the new system<br>6) Repeat 2-5 several times<br>7) Turn off legacy system<br>8) Spend days or weeks tediously migrating legacy data to new system.</p><p>Edit:
 Don't get me wrong and think I'm advocating tightly coupling your data 
and your DAL, but, proper planning will probably available most use 
cases for this.</p><p>Edit 2: I'm not talking about testing environments, either.  </p>

<p>Yes! That was a much better answer than I gave! Thanks Zack! :)</p><p>I'm
 going through the pain of switching one schema to another on a live

<p>Hi Adam, yes absolutely you're right in saying that you would also 
have to change your models as well. That would be the part where you 
would be replacing your ORM.</p><p>And yes you are correct in thinking 
that you would need to move the "save" method. In an upcoming tutorial I
 continue to build out the create and update methods, so hopefully that 
will show you how I would approach it.</p><p>I think perhaps I've over 
simplified the theory of switching stuff out. I do think think that 
thinking about these sorts of design patterns when building stuff like 
this has a lot of value.</p>

<p>Thank you! I don't understand why people are advocating using the 
repository pattern as the end to "tight coupling". Whether you use the 
repository pattern or not, as long as your models, or entities extend 
Eloquent, you're code will always be tightly coupled to Eloquent.</p>

<p>If you know longer want to use Laravel's ORM. Composer makes it 
really easy to switch out packages from the PHP community. Or if you 
wanted to switch to use PostgreSQL.</p><p>Using interfaces is a really 
good design pattern for engineering. If you take anything away from this
 tutorial, let that be it, rather than as, Zack mentioned, the rather 
more complex situation of actually moving to a completely different type
 of database.</p>

<p>I do not know the name of the design pattern but could you not also 
have a class that formats the return value from the database so no 
matter what database returns the controllers gets the same format?<br>So
 the controller still talks to the Repository but the repository talks 
to the say "Factory" class to format the return value from the database.</p>

<p>Nice article, thanks.</p><p>One question, in your example, are you still required to have a User class in the models folder that extends Eloquent?</p><p>That's
 the only way I could get it working but I felt that it kind of defeated
 the object of abstraction—unless I missed something of course.</p>

<p>Ah cool, I didn't miss anything then. One more Q: Is it beneficiary 
to abstract away the model too so that it doesn't rely on an ORM?</p><p>Or is the idea to extend Eloquent but not to have any specific ORM code in there, so it'll remain easy to swap it out?</p>

<p>The problem is, if you change to MongoDB, (which is not compatible 
with Eloquent) you have to override all of your relationships defined on
 your model, the save method, create method, destroy method and many

<p>That, of course! In my opinion, the best thing about using 
Repositories in Laravel is that you an hide your Eloquent queries from 
your controller, particularly queryScopes and unit test your controllers
 and views - which is really important.</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly. I think a lot of developers will be new to the concept
 of a design pattern. However, just like with almost every other design 
pattern in programming, there's always going to be misinterpretations. I
 think being aware of the repository pattern is overall a good thing :)</p>

<p>Hi!<br>I have a question:<br>So you create the service provider file<br>In app/lib/cribbb/storage.</p><p>But
 I think service is the core of whole application. Isn't it weird to put
 this kind of files in 'lib' folder? Lib should only contain some tools 
code, isn't it?</p><p>I know it may not be a problem, but I just think it's kind of ugly structure.</p>

<p>No I disagree, I think the repositories are core to your application 
and are no concern of the framework. Your namespaced code is part of 
your application's domain.</p><p>With that being said, if you don't 
think the structure is right for you, you are free to use a different 
structure. Laravel is very flexible in that sense.</p>

<p>Hey Philip,</p><p>Thanks for the article. It is really good work. All
 of yours are in fact. I have read quite a bit on the Repository Pattern
 with Laravel but one thing I have a hard time with is what should be in
 the models and what should not? What should be in the Repository 
patterns and what should not?</p><p>For instance, I understand any CRUD 
functions seems to make sense going in the Repository to abstract away 
from the Controllers, and relationships make sense staying in the Model 
because of the ORM.</p><p>What about everything in between? Any advice? Are presenters an options? Or even Attributes?</p>

 think it's hard to know what is "right" and what is "wrong". I'd say if
 it feels right in your project, then that is good enough.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I wanted to make sure there wasn't a 
standardized way to do this to keep your codebase organized. I love the 
Presenter idea and have started using these as well.</p><p>I guess for 
now, keeping anything to do with Eloquent in the models makes sense 
because it is directly related to Eloquent. Anything that can be 
substituted or abstracted can be put into my library.</p><p>Thanks for all your insights. Sometimes I feel half crazy wondering about these things.</p>

<p>Hey Phil. I have implemented your technique in my user registration 
with succeed. But, I failed in user authentication. I tried to use 
Auth::attempt() in EloquentUserRepository becuse I presumed the "use 
User" at the top of the class is some kind of reference to User model 
which is implemented Auth. But Laravel throw me this error :</p><p>Class 'Cribbb\Storage\User\Auth' not found</p><p>would
 you tell me what is wrong? is there some kind of different technique to
 do user authentication with this repository pattern?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>PS: sorry for my English. it's not my native language :)</p>

<p>Yeah I wouldn't do authentication in your repository. Your repository
 is only for storing data, it's not also for authentication.</p><p>If you keep reading this series I will be covering authentication in more depth :)</p><p>You are getting the error because the <code>Auth</code> class also needs to be among the <code>use</code> statements at the top of the class.

<p>I add the Auth class and it works. But you're right , it's seems not 
relevant to store data there.that's why we call it repository.<br>But I 
still like the idea to separate my authentication from the controllers, 
just like this repository concept, it keeps my controller tidy. Do you 
have any idea how to do that?<br>I am waiting for your next tutorial on that topic. Thanks.</p>

<p>Laravel already handles authentication for you, there's nothing 
really you need to do unless you want it to work in a totally different

<p>A great post, makes sense now. I was over complicating in my mind. One <br>question, in the Service provider can I simply add more bindings, like <br>so:</p><p>app-&gt;bind(<br>      'Cribbb\Storage\User\UserRepository',<br>      'Cribbb\Storage\User\EloquentUserRepository'<br>    );</p><p>   $this-&gt;app-&gt;bind(<br>      'Cribbb\Storage\User\ProductsRepository',<br>      'Cribbb\Storage\User\EloquentProductsRepository'<br>    );</p><p>   $this-&gt;app-&gt;bind(<br>      'Cribbb\Storage\User\StockRepository',<br>      'Cribbb\Storage\User\EloquentStockRepository'<br>    );<br>  }</p><p>}</p><p>Would this be correct?</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Absolutely! That's exactly what I do too.</p><p>I tend to have a 
Service Provider for all of my "storage" bindings. With Laravel you can 
do pretty much what you want, but I think using grouping them together 
in one Service Provider makes a lot of send.</p><p>Glad you found it useful :)</p>

<p>Once again Philip, a really well written tutorial. I really 
appreciate how good you are at taking complex theorems and breaking them
 down into the 4P’s (problem, promise, proof, proposition). Top marks.</p><p>What
 I enjoy about your work is how looking over the tutorial archive, I can
 see how you’ve grown as a developer. It allows myself to do the same! 
Infact I have tried coupling this tutorial with your “Advanced 
Validation as a Service for Larvel 4” (<a href="http://culttt.com/2014/01/13/a" rel="nofollow">http://culttt.com/2014/01/13/a</a>....
 I make sure that I keep my nice set of user validation rules in my 
app\lib folder and then initiate the validation through my user model 
which is referenced in my EloquentUserRepository. The issue I have is 
when the validation produces error messages in the $errors variable I 
get:</p><p>“Undefined property: app\lib\Storage\User\EloquentUserRepository::$error</p><p>Just
 wondering how I reference the validation interfaces/services with the 
eloquent repositories? In other words, how can I neatly join up your two
 tutorials?</p>
