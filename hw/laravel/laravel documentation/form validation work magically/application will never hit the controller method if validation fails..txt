The magic is in the way Laravel handles the request. There is a listener in the FormRequestServiceProvider which does validation *before* we hit the controller.
----------

application will never hit the controller method if validation fails.

=------------
By default, Laravel redirects the request back to the failed form with populated $errors variable (instance of familiar MessageBag).
