// app/routes.php

Validator:: extend( 'awesome' , function( $field, $value, $params)
{
 return $value == 'awesome' ;
});

// in formrequest file 

$rules = array(
 'username' => 'awesome' ,
 ); 


-----------
There’s no default location for custom validation rules to be defined, so I have added it within
the routes.php file to simplify the example. You could include a validators.php file and provide
custom validations in there if you like.

2. // app/validators/CustomValidation.php
class CustomValidation
 {
 public function awesome( $field, $value, $params)
{
 return $value == 'awesome' ;
 }
 }

I chose to put my validation class within the app/validators folder, and classmap that
folder with Composer.

we need to use the Validator::extend() method again

// app/routes.php

Validator:: extend( 'awesome' , 'CustomValidation@awesome' );
