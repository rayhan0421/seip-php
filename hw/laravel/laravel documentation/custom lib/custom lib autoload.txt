1.First step is to create the folder
cd app/
 
mkdir library
 
cd library

2.Now we need to add the folder to the autoload file

{
 "require": {
 "laravel/framework": "4.0.*"
 },
 "autoload": {
 "classmap": [
 "app/commands",
 "app/controllers",
 "app/library", /* Added here */
 "app/models",
 "app/database/migrations",
 "app/tests/TestCase.php"
 ]
 },
 "minimum-stability": "dev"
 }

3.use this : composer dump-autoload

Now you can use the library folder.
