sort() and rsort() — For sorting indexed arrays
asort() and arsort() — For sorting associative arrays by value
ksort() and krsort() — For sorting associative arrays by key

.............
Some of the functions you can use are:

array_multisort()
asort()
arsort()
krsort()
ksort()
natcasesort()
natsort()
rsort()
shuffle()
sort()

uasort()

uksort()
usort()

advantage :

The difference between these functions is that some will sort by value, sort by keys,
maintain the keys, replace the keys, user defined ordering, alphabetically order,
there are lots of different ways you would want to sort an array
so you need to make sure you are going to use the correct one.
