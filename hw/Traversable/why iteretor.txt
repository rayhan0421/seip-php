Implementing Iterator:
If you want to do some complex task like changing values or examining values before returning them, you need to implement Iterator.
Iterator is bit more complicated than IteratorAggregate.
It implements 5 functions are current(), key(), next(), rewind() and valid().
The current() function should return the current value in the iteration.
The key() function should return the key value of the current element.
The function next() should advance the iterator forward by one step.
The rewind() function should reset the iterator and valid() function should return a Boolean value to indicate if the value exists for the current iteration.
The PHP engine automatically calls these functions while traversing the values using foreach loop.
