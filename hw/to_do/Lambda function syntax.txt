Lambda function syntax

The patch adds the following syntax as a valid expression:

   function & (parameters) use (lexical vars) { body }

note : : The & is optional and indicates that the function should return a reference. The use followed by the parentheses is optional and indicates that several variables from the current scope should be imported into the closure.

Example usage:

   $lambda = function () { echo "Hello World!\n"; };


can be do this: 

 $lambda ();
   call_user_func ($lambda);
   call_user_func_array ($lambda, array ());


can be: 


Closure lifetime

Closures may live longer as the methods that declared them. It is perfectly possible to have something like this:

   function getAdder($x) {
     return function ($y) use ($x) {
       // or: lexical $x;
       return $x + $y;
     };
   }
