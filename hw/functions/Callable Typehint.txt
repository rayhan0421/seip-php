In PHP 5.4 (the newest version, and it has lots of shiny features), we have the Callable typehint. This allows us to check whether a thing is callable, either because it's a closure, an invokable object, or some other valid callback. Another trivial example to continue the butterflies and kittens theme:


function sparkles(Callable $func) {
  $func();
  return "fairy dust";
}

class Butterfly {
  public function __invoke() {
    echo "flutter";
  }
}

$bob = new Butterfly();
echo sparkles($bob); // flutterfairy dust
So there it is, one invokable object being passed into a function and successfully passing a Callable typehint.
