What is a closure?
A closure is a special type of anonymous function that encapsulates one or more variables from the scope it is created in when it is created. The name comes from the idea that this kind of function closes over these variables. This is not the same as passing an argument to a function or using the global keyword. Inside the closure the variable encapsulated contains the value its ‘parent’ had at the time the closure was created. Changes to the variable inside the closure do not affect the variable outside the closure. It’s this behaviour that differentiates a closure from an anonymous function (the PHP manual seems to use the terms interchangeably).
