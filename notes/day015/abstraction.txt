Abstraction is the process. Encapsulation is the mechanism by which Abstraction is implemented.

: Abstraction is the concept/technique used to identify what should be the external view of an object. Making only the required interface available.

.......
Abstraction is When we know 
a little about something and which can help 
us to manipulate something for which we don't know how it works internally.

With remote we know that pressing the number keys will change the channels. 
We are not aware as to what actually happens internally.
 We can manipulate the hidden thing but we don't know how it is being done internally.

Programmatically, when we can acess the hidden data somehow and know something.. is Abstraction ..
 And when we know nothing about the internals its Encapsulation.
