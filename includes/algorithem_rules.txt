1.Use language features to reduce operations (variable caching, chaining, etc).

2.Reduce iterative loop nesting as much as possible.

3.Define variables outside of loops when possible.

4.Use automatic loop indexing (if available) instead of manual indexing.

5.Use clever reduction techniques, such as recursive divide and conquer and query optimization, to minimize the size of recursive processes
